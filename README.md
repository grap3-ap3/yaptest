A penetration testing framework that helps automate the boring parts of pentests

=== Yet Another PenTEST... ===

Work in progress: This project has been forked from [https://github.com/pentestmonkey/yaptest this repo].  See also the [http://pentestmonkey.net/projects/yaptest/yaptest-overview/ official homepage] and [http://thegreyhats.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/getting-yaptest-to-run-under-ubuntu.html freakyclown's install notes].

As of this writing (3/12/2020) this is mostly used for the catalog of common username and password files for various services. Current catalog: 
	* Finger
	* FTP
	* MSSQL
	* MySQL
	* RLogin
	* SMB
	* SNMP
	* SSH
	* TFTP

Eventually, the scripts will get ported to python for platform independent use.
